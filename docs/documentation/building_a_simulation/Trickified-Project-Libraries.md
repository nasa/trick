During a simulation build, Trick generates several rounds of files to support data recording, checkpointing, and Python access:

* Trick generates `S_source.hh` from the `S_define`
* ICG recursively builds a tree of all header files included from `S_source.hh` and generates an `io_*.cpp` and `*_py.i` file for each
* SWIG converts all `*_py.i` to `*_py.cpp` files
* Trick compiles all `io_*.cpp` and `*_py.cpp` files along with the original source files

Due to this framework Trick creates, it is not feasible to build external libraries with trick utilities enabled. The external libraries must either be rebuilt with each clean sim build, or pre-compiled and sacrifice trick utilities.

This is where trickification comes in. Trickfication is a utility that allows external libraries to be compiled with trick utilities included. This covenience feature is intended save time on unnecessary rebuilding of external libraries that are not going be changed as part of normal workflow.

# Who's Responsible?
Support of Trickification is the project owner's responsibility. While it is possible for anyone to Trickify any set of files, you really want the project to maintain the files we're going to talk about. This will ensure that's it done correctly, in one place, and stays synchronized with the project.

# Trickifying Your Project
Trickifying your project requires only a few steps.
   1. Identify the files you want included in your library. You do not necessarily need to manually create this list, as trick-ify has options to dynamically generate this list.
   2. Run the trick-ify script. 
   3. Include S\_overrides\_trickify.mk in your sims Trickify.mk. S\_overrides\_trickify.mk is generated by trick-ify. Trickify.mk is a list of all trickified libraries you want to include in your build. Trickify.mk must be created by you, in the same directory as your S\_define.

# Trick-ify Script
The core script behind trickification is the trick-ify script (which lives at $(TRICK\_HOME)/bin/). While this script contains everything you need to trickify, it can be tedious to work with directly. We advise you check out the GUI section for a friendlier way to construct your trickify commands.

## Trick-ify Input Arguments
* --s\_define {path of your sims S\_define}
    * Optional argument that allows trick-ify to be built in the context of a particular sim. Enables several additional features for trick-ify.
        * Allows for trick-ify to automatically build the library based on what your sim actually uses. For example, if you wanted to build a trickified library from JEOD, this option would allow you to build a library that only contains JEOD files your sims uses, rather than the entire JEOD library.
        * Allows trick-ify to automatically create your Trickify.mk for you.
* --s\_define\_filter {list of paths}
    * This argument provides the list of directories to search under, if you provided an S\_define. Going back to the JEOD example, your arguments would look like --s\_define $(S\_DEFINE\_PATH) --s\_define\_filter $(JEOD\_HOME). In this example, you would build a trickified library with only the JEOD files your sim uses.
* -d {list of paths}
    * List of directories for trick-ify to include in the library. Trick-ify will recursively search these paths for all c/c++ files. Also accepts individual files. This argument can be used independently or alongside the above s\_define arguments.
* -ex {list of paths}
    * List of directories to exclude from your trickified library.

## Trick-ify Build Arguments
* --no\_source
    * Disables the building of source code. The trickified library will only contain ICG/SWIG files for the selected files.
        * This is primarily a legacy feature to recreate old trickify functionality.
* --build {path}
    * Build directory for the trickified library. By default will be the directory run from. Not recommended to be your sim directory.
* --include {list of paths}
    * Paths to use as -I includes during the library compilation.
* --s\_overrides {path}
    * S\_overrides.mk to include during the library build. Necessary if the library files expect and environment configured within an S\_overrides.
* --trick_home {path}
    * Location of your trick home. Defaults to the same trick install that the trick-ify script lives in.
* -b {a, o, so}
    * Which type of library to build.
* -n {string}
    * Name of the library. Needs to be unique if more than one library is included in the sim build.

## Trick-ify Advanced Make Arguments
These are additional build arguments that are not intended to be used by the vast majority of users. These options allow the user to modify some internal trick-ify behaviors by inserting arbitrary arguments to internal trick-ify calls. Unless you are trying to do something hacky, you can safely skip these options.

* --trickify\_args {string}
    * Make arguments to be provided when the trick-ify script calls trickify.mk.
        * make $(TRICKIFY\_ARGS) -f trickify.mk trickify
* --source\_make\_args {string}
    * Arguments to be provided to gcc when compiling the source files of the library. Note, this only applies to the source code compilation, not trick ICG/SWIG file compilation.

## Trick-ify Other Arguments
* -v
    * Verbose mode.
* --trickify\_make {path}
    * Location of the trickify.mk script. Defaults to the path located in the same trick install. User should not need to worry about this.

# Trick-ify GUI
The Trickify GUI is a covenience feature for generating trick-ify commands. The GUI is not required to trickify your project, nor does it provide any additional features compared to the core script. However, the GUI can simplify the process of formatting your script arguments.

The GUI allows for it's state to be exported/imported as a config file, with the options under the File menu item.

## Trickify GUI - Overview
![Trickify GUI Default S_define Tab](../data_products/images/Trickify-Default-S_define.png)
The Trickify GUI consists of several tabs of text fields, several buttons for discrete options, and two buttons for generating the trick-ify command.

### Discrete Options
* Full library build - Enabled by default. This option toggles whether the trickified library will contain source code object files or not. If disabled, the library will only contain swig and icg support files. 
    * Correlates to the script option --no\_source
* Debug info - Enables verbose mode 
    * Correlates to the script option -v
* Build Mode Dropdown Menu - Selects the type of library to create (.o, .a, .so).
    * Correlates to the script option -b
* Don't rebuild S\_source.hh - Disables the regeneration of the S\_source.hh, which contains the list of header files pulled into the library. Most users should leave this off.
    * Correlates to the script option --no\_clean\_s\_source
* Don't rebuild source file list - Disables the regeneration of the source file list, which contains the list of source files pulled into the library. Most users should leave this off.
    * Correlates to the script option --no\_clean\_src
* Don't rebuild object file list - Disables the regeneration of the object file list, which contains the list of object files pulled into the library. Most users should leave this off.
    * Correlates to the script option --no\_clean\_obj

### Buttons
* Trickify - Runs your trick-ify command. Will run with respect to GUI's working directory.
* Print - Prints your trick-ify command to the console, without running the command. 

## Trickify GUI - S\_define Tab
![Trickify GUI Default S_define Tab](../data_products/images/Trickify-Default-S_define.png)
This tabs is for building a library with respect to a particular sim. By trickifying with an S\_define, trick-ify is able to automatically generate the list of files you need from a particular repository. On top of simplifying the trickifcation process, this method ensures only files your sim uses are included in the library, reducing the libraries size and build time.

For example, say you have a sim that makes use of JEOD. If you only wish to include JEOD files your sim actually uses, instead of the full JEOD library, you would use this method.

Limitation: If you have multiple sims that make use of the same repository, this method would require you to trickify each sim separately. If you want to create a generic library for a repository, that includes all of its files, see the Input tab below.

* S\_define - Which S\_define you wish to build your library in respect to.
    * Correlates to the script option --s\_define
* S\_define Includes - Which directories you want included in the library. Only uses files relative to the above S_define. Accepts multiple paths.
    * Correlates to the script option --s\_define\_filter
* S\_overrides.mk - This S\_overrides.mk will be used during the trickify build. You typically want to use whichever S\_overrides.mk is associated with the above S\_define. Note, even if you are not using an S\_define you can still choose to include an S\_overrides.mk in the build process.
    * Correlates to the script option --s\_define\_filter

## Trickify GUI - Inputs Tab
![Trickify GUI Default Inputs Tab](../data_products/images/Trickify-Default-Inputs.png)
This tab is for generic input options that are indifferent to the S_define options.

* Source Directories - Provided paths will be recursively searched for all files with common C/C++ extensions. All identified files will be included in the library. This option can be used independently of or alongside S\_define options.
    * Correlates to the script option -d
* Trick Home Directory - Path to your trick installation. Auto-populated by $(TRICK\_HOME)
    * Correlates to the script option --trick\_home
* trickify.mk Directory - Path to your trick installations makefile directory. Auto-populated by $(TRICK\_HOME)
    * Correlates to the script option --trickify\_make
* Includes - -I includes to provide to gcc
    * Correlates to the script option --include
* Excludes - Paths to exclude from the library. After the total list of files has been generated from the source directories and S\_define, the list will be filtered for paths found in this argument.
    * Correlates to the script option --ex

## Trickify GUI - Outputs Tab
![Trickify GUI Default Outputs Tab](../data_products/images/Trickify-Default-Outputs.png)
This tab details where the library should be built

* Build Path - Where the library, along with all build artifacts, will be created. If left empty, will build in the working directory.
    * Correlates to the script option --build
* Library Name - Name of the library. Extension will be appeneded automatically. If you are using multiple trickified libraries in your sim, the names need to be unique.
    * Correlates to the script option -n

## Trickify GUI - Advanced Tab
![Trickify GUI Default Advanced Tab](../data_products/images/Trickify-Default-Advanced.png)
This tab is for advanced options, that 99% of users won't care about. These are all optional, and only exists for compatiability purposes with libraries that don't like being trickified.

* Trickify Args - The final step of trickification is calling the makefile $(TRICK\_HOME)/share/trick/makefiles/trickify.mk. This argument is passed directly into that make call.
    * Correlates to the script option --trickify\_args
* Source Make - This argument is used to build the source files of the library, overriding trick-ify's own build process. This argument is expected to build all of the source files, and leave their associated .o in the same path. This argument is expected to be a full command line instruction, and will be executed as is.
    * Correlates to the script option --source\_make
* Source Args - This argument is passed directly into trick-ify's default gcc calls. Only valid if not using the above Source Make option.
    * Correlates to the script option --source\_make\_args
