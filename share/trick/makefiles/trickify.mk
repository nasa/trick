# This file can be used to create an object file or library containing the io_*
# and *_py code that Trick would normally generate during the simulation build
# process. Sims can then link against that, reducing compilation time.
#
# To use it, create a directory that includes a file named S_source.hh that
# includes all header files for which you want io_* and _py* code generated.
# This is not the S_source.hh that Trick generates during compilation, but
# Trick's tools assume this name for now, so you have to use it. Then, in that
# directory, run the following command:
#
# make -f $(TRICK_HOME)/share/trick/makefiles/trickify.mk
#
# You can, of course, call this from your own makefile. But remember to switch
# to the directory containing your S_source.hh first using make's -C option if
# necessary. For instance:
#
# all:
# 	$(MAKE) -C <directory> -f $(TRICK_HOME)/share/trick/makefiles/trickify.mk
#
# There are a number of variables you can export from your own makefile or
# define on the command line when calling make:
#
# TRICKIFY_CXX_FLAGS (required)
# Define this variable to specify compiler flags. Most importantly, include the
# paths to the header files included by your S_source.hh. For instance:
# -I$(HOME)/myproject/foo/include -I$(HOME)/myproject/bar/include
#
# TRICKIFY_BUILD_TYPE (optional)
# Valid options are:
# 1. STATIC (.a)
#    Create a static library. This will require the use of --whole-archive (on
#    Linux) or -all_load/-force_load (on Mac) when linking the sim executeable.
#    Trick uses dlsym to dynamically load symbols at run time, but the linker,
#    by default, will not include symbols from static libraries that are not
#    known to be needed at compile time.
# 2. SHARED (.so)
#    Create a shared object (dynamically linked library). This may require the
#    use of -rpath to ensure the linker can find the shared object at runtime
#    unless you explicitly link against it (as opposed to using -L and -l)
#    during compilation.
# 3. PLO (.o) [default]
#    Create a partially-linked object. No special linker options are required.
#
# TRICKIFY_OBJECT_NAME (optional)
# The name of the generated object file or library. The default value is
# trickified.o. You should choose something more meaningful, especially if
# you're using another build type.
#
# TRICKIFY_PYTHON_DIR (optional)
# The file into which generated Python modules are zipped. The default
# value is python (in the current directory).

# EXAMPLE:

#
# $(HOME)/potato/
#     include/
#     trickified/
#         S_source.hh
#         Makefile
#
# The following Makefile would be appropriate:
#
# ifndef TRICK_HOME
#     $(error TRICK_HOME must be set)
# endif
#
# TRICKIFY := $(TRICK_HOME)/share/trick/makefiles/trickify.mk
#
# ifeq ($(wildcard $(TRICKIFY)),)
#     $(error This makefile requires at least Trick 17.1)
# endif
#
# export TRICKIFY_CXX_FLAGS := -I$(HOME)/potato/include
# export TRICKIFY_OBJECT_NAME := trickified_potato.o
#
# all:
# 	$(MAKE) -f $(TRICKIFY)
#
# clean:
# 	rm -rf $(TRICKIFY_OBJECT_NAME) build python .trick

# SWIG_OBJECTS and IO_OBJECTS are meant to contain all of the *_py and io_*
# object file names, respectively, by looking at products of ICG and
# make_makefile_swig. However, we can't run a rule for ICG before those
# variables are expanded because they are prerequisites of
# TRICKIFY_OBJECT_NAME, and prerequisites are immediately expanded.
# Therefore, when make processes this file (for the first time after a clean),
# the variables are empty because the files from which they are populated have
# yet to be created by ICG. What we really want is to run ICG before OBJECTS is
# expanded, but only if we need to.
#
# We can do this by taking advantage of (abusing) make's behavior in the
# presence of included files. When you include another file, make attempts to
# update that file, and then re-executes the original makefile with a clean
# slate if any of the included files changed. So we need a rule that:
#
# 1. Executes only if S_source.hh or anything in its include tree changes.
# 2. Runs ICG and make_makefile_swig to generate io_* files and S_library_swig.
# 3. Updates its dependency file.
#
# We can then include the dependency file to trigger make to re-execute this
# main makefile if changes were detected, thus updating SWIG_OBJECTS and
# IO_OBJECTS to the latest results of ICG and make_makefile_swig.
#
# gcc's option to automatically generate dependency information is exactly
# what we need. It will produce a file containing a make rule whose
# dependencies are everything in S_source.hh's include tree plus S_source.hh
# itself. By telling gcc to make the target of the rule the same target we use
# to execute the gcc call, we end up with a target that maintains its own
# dependency list. The method is laid out in more detail here:
# http://make.mad-scientist.net/papers/advanced-auto-dependency-generation/
