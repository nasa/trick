I'm learning python vtk and am looking for advice on how to move actors in a scene that have a parented relationship. For example, let's say I want to simulate a human arm starting from the shoulder and ending at the fingers. This actor would have an upper arm, lower arm, wrist, and 5 individual fingers each with 2 joints. Each joint would be driven in the scene by an angle relative to the joint above it. For right now I don't want code, I want to know what the VTK framework provides or does not provide for this type of use case. I have read a little bit about vtkAssembly and am wondering if my human arm example is a good fit for a vtkAssembly, or if there's other options that might be better?

Great question — you're thinking along the right lines about hierarchical transforms in VTK. Let’s step back and look at what VTK does (and does **not**) provide for your use case:

---

### 1. **What VTK Provides**

* **`vtkAssembly`**

  * This is the most direct built-in feature for grouping actors.
  * Lets you parent multiple `vtkProp3D` objects (like `vtkActor`s) under a common parent.
  * Transforms applied to the parent (`vtkAssembly`) affect all children.
  * Each child can still have its own local transform relative to the parent.
  * This makes it a good fit for hierarchical structures (like an arm → forearm → wrist → fingers).
  * Example mental model: rotate the shoulder → upper arm rotates → forearm, wrist, and fingers come along for the ride.

* **`vtkTransform`**

  * Every `vtkActor` (and `vtkAssembly`) has a transformation (`SetUserTransform`, `SetPosition`, `RotateX/Y/Z`, etc.).
  * You can explicitly define transforms for each joint.
  * Transforms can be concatenated (e.g., shoulder rotation \* elbow rotation \* wrist rotation).
  * For joint-based motion (like your arm), this is the fundamental mechanism you’d use.

* **Scene Graph via Assemblies**

  * VTK is not a scene graph engine per se, but `vtkAssembly` gives you the basics: hierarchical transformations and grouping.
  * You can nest assemblies arbitrarily deep (shoulder → upper arm assembly → forearm assembly → wrist assembly → finger assemblies).

---

### 2. **What VTK Does *Not* Provide**

* **No Built-in Skeleton / Rigging System**

  * Unlike game engines (Unreal, Unity) or 3D animation libraries (Blender, Maya), VTK does not have skeletons, bones, or skinning.
  * You must build the hierarchy manually using assemblies or custom transform chains.

* **No IK (Inverse Kinematics) or FK (Forward Kinematics) Out of the Box**

  * If you want kinematics (e.g., move the hand and the arm bends accordingly), you’d need to implement that logic yourself.
  * VTK will happily render the transforms, but you drive the math.

* **No Automatic Deformation**

  * If you want mesh deformation (e.g., skin stretching as the elbow bends), that’s outside the scope of VTK. You’d need custom mesh manipulation.

---

### 3. **Your Arm Example**

For a human arm made of rigid pieces:

* Model each rigid part as its own `vtkActor`.
* Group actors in `vtkAssembly` hierarchies:

  * `shoulderAssembly` → contains `upperArmActor` and `forearmAssembly`.
  * `forearmAssembly` → contains `forearmActor` and `wristAssembly`.
  * `wristAssembly` → contains `wristActor` and multiple `fingerAssemblies`.
* Each finger is itself a chain of assemblies for joints.
* Drive joint rotations by updating transforms at the appropriate assembly level.
* Rotating a parent automatically moves all descendants.

This is **exactly** the intended use case of `vtkAssembly`.

---

### 4. **Alternative Approaches**

* **Manual Transform Concatenation**

  * Instead of `vtkAssembly`, you can manually concatenate `vtkTransform`s for each joint and assign them to the appropriate actor.
  * This gives more control but also more bookkeeping.

* **Custom Prop3D Hierarchy**

  * If you want something beyond `vtkAssembly`, you can subclass `vtkProp3D` and manage your own hierarchy, but that’s usually unnecessary unless you need special behavior.

---

✅ **Bottom Line:**
For your rigid arm + joints example, **`vtkAssembly` is the right tool**. It gives you a clean hierarchical relationship, and you can animate by rotating each assembly at the joint level.

If you later want deformations (skin/muscles), you’ll need to step outside VTK’s built-ins.

---

Do you want me to also outline **best practices for setting up the transforms** (e.g., how to choose joint pivot points in VTK, since they don’t automatically align to geometry)? That’s one of the gotchas with using `vtkAssembly` for skeletal-like hierarchies.


yes please

---
Perfect — that’s one of the key pain points when using **`vtkAssembly`** for something skeletal-like.
Here are the **best practices / gotchas** around transforms and pivot points in VTK:

---

## 1. **Actors rotate around their origin**

* By default, a `vtkActor` (or any `vtkProp3D`) rotates around **its local origin** `(0,0,0)` in object space.
* If your geometry (say, the upper arm mesh) is modeled with the shoulder at `(0,0,0)`, then rotating the actor makes it pivot correctly.
* BUT if the geometry is centered elsewhere (e.g., modeled around its midpoint), rotations won’t look like they’re happening at the shoulder.

👉 **Best practice:** When creating geometry, place the pivot point at the joint location in model space.

---

## 2. **Moving the pivot without remodeling geometry**

If you can’t (or don’t want to) remodel your mesh, VTK gives you two options:

* **`SetOrigin()`**

  * You can set the rotation/scaling origin of an actor relative to its model coordinates.
  * Example: if the elbow is at `(0, -5, 0)` in model coordinates, you can call

    ```python
    actor.SetOrigin(0, -5, 0)
    ```

    and rotations will pivot around that point.

* **Geometry translation trick**

  * Alternatively, you can preprocess your mesh:
    shift geometry so the joint is at `(0,0,0)`, then use the actor’s `SetPosition()` to put it back in world space.
  * This is useful when you want clean pivoting logic but keep geometry “nice” for modeling.

---

## 3. **Assemblies and Local vs. Global Transforms**

* An assembly applies its transform to all children.
* Child actors keep their own **local** transform relative to the assembly’s coordinate system.
* This is powerful, but:

  * Don’t set both `SetUserTransform()` **and** `SetPosition()/RotateX()` on the same actor unless you know how they combine — it can get confusing.
  * Pick **one transform path** and stick with it.

👉 **Best practice:** For joints, use `SetOrigin()` to define the pivot, then apply `RotateX/Y/Z()` to animate.

---

## 4. **Hierarchy setup (arm example)**

* Shoulder → rotate around `(0,0,0)` at top of upper arm.
* Forearm assembly → attach at elbow pivot, set origin at elbow joint.
* Wrist assembly → set origin at wrist joint.
* Fingers → each finger segment has its own origin at the knuckle/joint.

That way:

* Rotating the **shoulder** moves the entire arm and hand.
* Rotating the **elbow** moves the forearm, wrist, and fingers (but not the upper arm).
* Rotating a **finger joint** only affects that finger branch.

---

## 5. **Debugging Transforms**

* Use `actor.GetMatrix()` or `assembly.GetMatrix()` to inspect the 4×4 world transform at runtime.
* Print these while animating to confirm hierarchy and pivot logic are behaving as expected.
* If things look “off,” check:

  * Is your pivot (`SetOrigin`) correct?
  * Are you applying transforms in local or world space?

---

✅ **Bottom line:**

* **Model geometry with pivots in mind if possible.**
* If not, use `SetOrigin()` carefully to define joint locations.
* Use nested `vtkAssembly` objects to build the hierarchy.
* Stick to one transform path (origin + rotations), and debug with `GetMatrix()` if things misbehave.

---

Would you like me to sketch out a **minimal arm hierarchy diagram (assemblies + pivots)** so you can visualize how the pieces fit together in VTK before coding?

yes please

---
Great — here’s a **hierarchy sketch** for your arm example, showing how you’d structure assemblies and pivots in VTK. Think of it like a tree where each node can be rotated, and all children follow along.

### Human Arm Hierarchy (VTK Assembly Style)

```
ShoulderAssembly (pivot at shoulder joint)
│
├── UpperArmActor  (geometry: upper arm, origin at shoulder)
│
└── ElbowAssembly (pivot at elbow joint)
    │
    ├── ForearmActor  (geometry: forearm, origin at elbow)
    │
    └── WristAssembly (pivot at wrist joint)
        │
        ├── HandActor  (geometry: hand/palm, origin at wrist)
        │
        └── FingerAssemblies (5 total, one per finger, pivot at knuckle)
            │
            ├── FingerSegment1Actor (proximal phalanx, origin at knuckle)
            │
            └── FingerJointAssembly (pivot at first joint)
                │
                ├── FingerSegment2Actor (middle phalanx, origin at joint)
                └── FingerTipAssembly (pivot at fingertip joint)
                    └── FingerSegment3Actor (distal phalanx)
```

---

### Key Notes

* **Assemblies** = joints.
  Each `vtkAssembly` acts like a “bone pivot” — when rotated, it moves all children.

* **Actors** = rigid geometry pieces (upper arm, forearm, finger bones, etc.).

* **Origin** of each actor should be set to its **joint location**, so rotations pivot correctly.
  Example:

  * `UpperArmActor.SetOrigin(shoulder_position)`
  * `ForearmActor.SetOrigin(elbow_position relative to forearm geometry)`

* **Rotation workflow**:

  * Rotate `ShoulderAssembly` → whole arm rotates.
  * Rotate `ElbowAssembly` → forearm, wrist, and fingers follow.
  * Rotate a `FingerJointAssembly` → only that finger bends.

---

### Mental Picture

Think of `vtkAssembly` as invisible “bones” (joints), and `vtkActor`s as the “meshes” attached to those bones. You animate by rotating the assemblies, not by moving the raw actors directly.

Would it help if I also show you a **schematic diagram** (boxes + arrows) of this hierarchy, so you can visually see parent-child relationships and pivot points?
