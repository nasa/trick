## Satellite Example

This example usage of VIRGO is inspired by `SIM_satellite` from [the Trick repository](https://github.com/nasa/trick/tree/master/trick_sims/SIM_satellite) and actually uses data generated from the sim which has been copied here in `log_satellite.csv`. 

* `log_satellite.csv`: Tracked Trickpy-compliant data file generated by Trick's `SIM_satellite`
* `scene.yml`: YAML scene file representing the `dict` VIRGO needs to build the 3D scene
* `satellite.py`: Script that launches VIRGO using `scene.yml` and `log_satellite.csv`
