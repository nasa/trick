# Pendulum Example

This directory provides an example of VIRGO rendering simulated pendulums. The entire example is self-contained within `pendulums.py` which both generates the data VIRGO reads and renders the scene using that data.  Important files in this directory:

* `pendulums.py`: Generates pendulum position data(s) and renders them by calling VIRGO internal functions
* `log_pendulum*.csv`: Untracked Trickpy-compliant data files generated by `pendulums.py`
* `scene.yml`: YAML scene file representing the `dict` VIRGO needs to build the 3D scene

Please take a look at these files as there's extensive comments explaining the configuration.

The pendulum position is the only part simulated and rendered, not it's orientation. You can see this by pressing 'a' to see the actor axes when the script runs. **TODO Add more info here. I think this example is perfect for a VIRGO tutorial as we can have the user start with one pendulum and slowly build up to the configuration you see in this directory today**
