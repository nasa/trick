-# Wait for all synchronous threads to finish initializing before entering infinite loop
-# Enter an infinite loop.  A call to exec_terminate(const char *) or
   exec_terminate_with_return(int, const char *, int , const char * ) will exit the loop.
    -# For all asynchronous must finish threads that are to finish at this time, wait for their completion
    -# If the exec_command equals freeze mode, call Trick::Executive::freeze_loop().  Transition from
       freeze back to run will continue execution at this point.
       Requirement  [@ref r_exec_mode_1]
    -# Set the job complete flags for all jobs to false.
    -# Check to see if all child threads are alive.  If a thread has exited, call
       Trick::Executive::exec_terminate_with_return(int, char *, int, char *)
       Requirement  [@ref r_exec_thread_7]
    -# Signal threads to start the next time step of processing.
    -# For each scheduled jobs whose next call time is equal to the current simulation time [@ref ScheduledJobQueue]
        -# Wait for all job dependencies to complete.  Requirement  [@ref r_exec_thread_6]
        -# Call the job.  Requirement  [@ref r_exec_periodic_0]
        -# If the job is a system job, check to see if the next job call time is the lowest next time by
           calling Trick::ScheduledJobQueue::test_next_job_call_time(Trick::JobData *, long long)
    -# If the exec_command equals ExitCmd
