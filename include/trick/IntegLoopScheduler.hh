    /**
     * This class is a Scheduler that provides the ability to integrate a
     * collection of sim object instances over time.  The IntegLoopScheduler
     * schedules for following job classes:
     *  - Pre-integration jobs.\n
     *    The pre-integration jobs are the set of jobs that are to be called
     *    prior to advancing state.
     *  - Derivative jobs and integration jobs.\n
     *    State is advanced by repeatedly calling all of the derivative class
     *    jobs and then all of the integration class jobs until the integration
     *    jobs indicate that the target time has been reached.
     *  - Dynamic event jobs.\n
     *    The dynamic event jobs are used to search for events that
     *    intrinsically change the behaviors of the derivatives. Since such
     *    events change behavior, state is be integrated back to the point
     *    where the event occurs and then integrated forward to the desired
     *    target time.
     *  - Post-integration jobs.\n
     *    The post-integration jobs are called after state is advanced to the
     *    target time.
     *  .
     *
     * The set of sim objects to be integrated by an IntegLoopScheduler can be
     * specified at construction time, but can be also changed during runtime.
     * Sim objects can be added to or removed from an IntegLoopScheduler, and
     * can be moved from one IntegLoopScheduler to another.
     *
     * Additionally, this class may have multiple integration rates specified for
     * executing the integration loop up to each point in time. For instance, if
     * the user specifies a 0.01 integration rate and a 0.015 integration rate,
     * the scheduler will integrate using a dt for each step and reschedules
     * itself so that each rate is satisfied. i.e. it will integrate at:
     *  - 0.000->0.010
     *  - 0.010->0.015
     *  - 0.015->0.020
     *  - 0.020->0.030
     *  - 0.030->0.040
     *  - 0.040->0.045
     *
     * Because it acts as a self-scheduler that updates its job
     * rate with the Trick::Executive, this class complies with the standard Trick job
     * scheduling scheme.
